# FantasySampler
Simple Python script that displays the share of players in top 100 teams overall. Works for current or past GameWeeks**. Can be modified for top 150,200..etc.


** Past GWs only returns specific GW sample of the current top 100. Fantasy API doesn't provide overall standings history for a specific GW. It does provide standings for that particular GW however that doesn't equal overall standings at the time.
